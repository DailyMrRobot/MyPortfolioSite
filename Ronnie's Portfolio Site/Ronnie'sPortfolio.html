Based off the difficulty chosen by the user, If the selected difficulty was on a higher difficulty such as very hard or hard, the user has a higher chance of losing the game. However if the difficulty was on a lower difficulty such as Very Easy, Easy or hard. The user would have a higher chance of winning the game. The bot could be triggered by a specific command, such as "!rrve" for Russian Roulette Very Easy or "!rrvh" for Russian Roulette Very Hard.
